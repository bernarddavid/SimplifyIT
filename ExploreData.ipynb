       "      <td>The 1992 Pacific hurricane season was the most active Pacific hurricane season on record . The most notable storm was Hurricane Iniki , which caused billions of dollars of damage to the Hawaiian Islands . Hurricanes Lester , Virgil , Winifred , and Orlene also made landfall and killed several people , but were significantly less destructive . Hurricane Darby and Tropical Storm Agatha brought rains and more destruction to Mexico , without making landfall . Hurricane Tina was the longest-lasting Pacific hurricane at the time . Also of note are Hurricane Ekeka and Tropical Storm Hali , which formed in late January and late March , respectively .\\n The season officially started on May 15 , 1992 in the Eastern Pacific , and on June 1 , 1992 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 1992 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern and north-central Pacific Ocean . However , the season wildly exceeded these bounds , as climatological effects including an El NiÃ o caused Hurricane Ekeka to form on January 26 . Ekeka 's formation marks a record for the earliest formation of a tropical cyclone in either the Eastern or Central Pacific basins . It is also the only known time that multiple cyclones had formed before the season began .\\n During the season , twenty-seven tropical cyclones formed in the Eastern Pacific -LRB- east of longitude 140 Â W -RRB- , and twenty-four underwent further cyclogenesis to become tropical storms . Both of these figures constitute records in the basin , as the 1992 season surpassed the season with the most tropical cyclones -LRB- 1982 , 26 -RRB- and the season with the most named storms -LRB- 1985 , 22 -RRB- . Of these , fourteen reached hurricane strength and eight became major hurricaneâ '' storms that reach Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale .\\n This season had five storms reach tropical storm intensity or higher in the month of October , the only time that had happened in this basin . In addition , Hurricanes or Tropical Storms Winifred through Zeke are the earliest twenty-first through twenty-fourth named storms in a season in the eastern north Pacific .\\n The Central Pacific -LRB- between 140 Â W and the International Date Line -RRB- saw similarly high levels of activity . Eleven tropical cyclones were tracked by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center throughout the hurricane season . Of those , eight developed in the Eastern Pacific and crossed into the Central Pacific , and three formed within the basin . Two of the storms strengthened to major hurricane status within the Central Pacific 's boundaries .\\n One of the crossover storms , Iniki , crossed into the basin as a tropical depression , strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane , and made landfall in Hawaii , becoming the most destructive hurricane in the state 's history .\\n Ekeka , the first storm of the season , developed from an area of disturbed weather near Kiritimati in the Line Islands . The tropical disturbance had been tracked since January 23 , and at 0600 UTC January 28 , the Central Pacific Hurricane Center determined that the area had met the meteorological characteristics of a tropical depression , and designated the system as Tropical Depression One-C . This was unusual , since the system was located well to the south of the area of normal tropical cyclone formation , further south than any other Pacific hurricane , and the formation occurred well outside the climatological bounds of the hurricane season . The system intesified and reached tropical storm status 12 hours later , at which point it became known as Ekeka .\\n The system continued intensifying until reaching hurricane status at 0000 UTC on January 30 , and it reached major hurricane status on February 2 , reaching maximum sustained winds of 115 mph -LRB- 185 km\\/h -RRB- and a minimum central barometric pressure of 985 mbar -LRB- hPa ; 29.09 inHg -RRB- . However , unfavorable wind shear began taking a toll on the storm , causing it to rapidly weaken . Ekeka crossed the International Date Line as a weakened tropical storm , and shortly thereafter degraded to tropical depression status . Ekeka continued westward , passing through the Marshall Islands and later over Chuuk , before dissipating on February 9 about 310 mi -LRB- 500 km -RRB- off the north coast of Papua New Guinea . The storm did not cause any significant damage or deaths .\\n The history set by Hurricane Ekeka repeated itself when , on March 28 , another low-latitude area of thunderstorms organized into Tropical Depression Two-C , just north of 5 Ë N , atypically close to the equator . The next day , it intensified into a tropical storm and received the name Hali , which is Hawaiian for Holly . The tropical storm reached its peak intensity on March 29 , packing sustained winds of 50 mph -LRB- 85 km\\/h -RRB- . Almost immediately thereafter , wind shear blew away the top of the system and caused it to fall apart . The Central Pacific Hurricane Center declared the system dissipated on March 30 .\\n Tropical Storm Hali had no impact on land . However , it is also a meteorological enigma , as it is the only known Pacific tropical cyclone east of the dateline to develop in the month of March .\\n A tropical wave that entered the Pacific in late May organized into Tropical Depression One-E on June 1 . It moved north for the next two days . The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on June 2 . After peaking the same day , Agatha slowed down and started drifting west . It steadily weakened , falling to a depression on June 5 . Agatha had dissipated by the next day . Agatha approached close enough to the coast of Mexico that watches and warnings were issued .\\n An estimated 1,500 people were evacuated due to the storms ' approach . Waves up to 16 f were reported along the coast of Mexico and torrential rains triggered flash flooding resulting in ten fatalities .\\n A tropical depression formed near 114 Â W on June 16 . The system moved west for a short time , reaching a peak intensity 1009 mbar and maximum sustained winds of 35 m. It dissipated , without strengthening , on June 19 .\\n A tropical wave crossed over Dakar , Africa on June 4 and passed the Cape Verde Islands the next day . The wave continued westward and on June 10 , passed the Windward Islands . The wave went through Central America during the period of June 14 and June 16 . The system entered the Eastern Pacific basin without gaining much convection . Over waters marginally suitable for cyclogenesis , a tropical wave organized into the second depression of the season on June 22 . It briefly reached tropical storm strength on June 23 . It then moved over cooler waters and dissipated the next day . Blas did not have any impact on land masses .\\n Celia 's origin as a tropical wave on June 8 off the coast of Africa . The system moved toward Central America and crossed over into the East Pacific basin around the 19th . The NHC declared the wave as a tropical depression on June 22 farther east than usual due to the low vertical wind shear . The NHC declared it as a tropical storm on the 23rd and was given the name Celia . Soon afterward , Celia started strengthening and soon became a hurricane . Celia started deepening rapidly starting around June 26 and soon became a Category 4 major hurricane with winds of 125 k and a minimal pressure of 935 mbar . Celia maintained Category 4 intensity for about 24 hours and then started to gradually weaken . Celia fell below hurricane status on July 2 and to tropical depression status the next day . Thereafter , all that was left of Celia was a swirl of low-convection clouds and was impossible to recognize on July 4 .\\n A tropical wave organized into tropical depression Five-E on July 2 . It strengthened and was named Darby the next day . Steering currents became very strong , and Darby accelerated as it paralleled the coast of Mexico . It strengthened into a hurricane on July 5 and also substantially increased in size . It peaked as a strong Category 3 on July 6 . Darby began to substantially weaken thereafter as it passed over cooler waters . The hurricane weakened into a storm and then a depression on July 8 and July 9 , respectively . Tropical Depression Darby lost tropical characteristics the next day . Moisture from the hurricane eventually spread over parts of the Continental United States .\\n During Darby 's formation , flooding from the cyclone 's rainbands killed three people in Acapulco , where 180 shops were damaged . Four fishermen were reported missing , fate unknown . Manzanillo , Colima , reported sustained winds just above tropical-storm force . The hurricane 's remnants brought mainly light rain to the U.S. state of California . Cloud cover also delayed the landing of the Space Shuttle Columbia for one day . South-facing beaches of that state were pounded with waves up to 7 feet -LRB- 2.3 m -RRB- in height . A monetary value for damage is not available .\\n Darby also caused a few shipping accidents . A pleasure craft , the Oasis , had an engine failure and was abandoned . The seven people aboard were rescued , but the boat was sunk . A smaller sailboat , the Hosanna , had difficulties but was towed to a safe location by a cutter from the United States Coast Guard . A fishing boat at an unspecified location also experienced difficulties .\\n The origin of Hurricane Estelle is unclear . The National Hurricane Center indicates that it may have formed from a tropical wave that began on June 23 off the African coast . The wave began to move at low latitudes and passed the northern part of South America . On July 2 , deep convection began to join with the wave as it crossed into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 7 . Reports indicate that the wave strengthened into Tropical Depression Six-E on July 9 . Eighteen hours later , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Estelle in unusually strong shear . The shear began to weaken and an eye began to form within Estelle 's circulation on July 11 . The eye formation caused the NHC to upgrade Estelle to a minimal hurricane .\\n From early July 11 to late July 15 , Estelle moved at about 7 - 15 m to the northwest . During this period , Estelle reached 140 m winds and became a Category 4 hurricane . The system weakened gradually and by July 17 , Estelle had completely lost its tropical characteristics . The hurricane did not affect any land in its lifetime , thus no damage was reported .\\n Frank was a long lived major hurricane . A tropical wave became Tropical Depression Seven-E on July 13 . It strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Frank on July 14 . It became a hurricane the next day . After peaking as a Category 4 storm it entered cold water on July 18 and weakened to a tropical storm on July 21 and degenerated to a low on July 23 .\\n A tropical wave left Africa in early July and crossed the Atlantic , with no development whatsoever in that basin and crossed into the eastern Pacific , eventually organizing itself into Tropical Depression Eight-E on July 14 . It became a tropical storm the next day and was named Georgette by the NHC . Georgette quickly organized into a minimal hurricane 18 hours later . On the 18th , Georgette strengthened quickly to reach a peak of 110 mph -LRB- 175 km\\/h -RRB- and a minimum pressure of 964 mbar . It then began to weaken and eventually dissipated on July 26 southwest of Hawaii without ever making landfall .\\n On July 26 a tropical depression formed and became a weak tropical storm the next day . It steadily organized , ad reached it peak intensity as a strong tropical storm . It then began to weaken , despite being located over warm waters . Howard dissipated several days later without affecting land .\\n Isis formed on July 28 as a depression and became a tropical storm the next day . Isis peaked as a strong tropical storm with 65 m winds on July 30 . Due to cooler water , it weakened to a depression on the first and dissipated the next day . Isis degenerated to an broad area of low pressure on August 2 .\\n Javier formed from a tropical wave that left Africa on July 17 . It organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E on July 30 . It became a tropical storm four days later later and was named Javier . After peaking as a minimal hurricane , Javier dissipated on August 12 . No fatalities or damage was reported .\\n Twelve-E had a peak windspeed of 35 mph -LRB- 55 km -RRB- , and a pressure of 1008 mb . It formed August 10 , and dissipated August 12 .\\n A depression formed on August 18 . It became a tropical storm shortly after forming and was named Kay . Kay was a short lived system . Its peak intensity was only 50 m. However , Kay was a very small tropical storm . It dissipated on August 22 . Kay never impacted anyone .\\n Lester was the first actual landfall of the Eastern Pacific season . The hurricane first made landfall in Baja California Peninsula on the August 23 , striking mainland Mexico late that day . Accelerating northeast , Lester entered the U.S. state of Arizona as a tropical storm and New Mexico as a tropical depression before ejecting out into the Plains .\\n No deaths were reported . Lester left over 5000 people homeless . Several tiny settlements west of Hermosillo , Sonora , and on a highway to San Diego , California , were destroyed . A ship called the Gladiator rolled over 33 degrees to both starboard and port , spilling a considerable amount of cargo .\\n Far in the open ocean , a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on August 27 . Banding and convection increased , and the depression became a tropical storm the next day . Development continued , and Madeline peaked with a minimum pressure of 999 mb , and winds of 45 k , on August 29 . As the system progressed westward , it entered a region of strong wind shear and had dissipated on August 31 . The system never came near land .\\n Newton was fairly short-lived storm . It formed from a tropical wave on August 27 . It became a tropical storm , was named Newton 18 hours later , and dissipated four days later on August 31 . Newton never impacted any land .\\n Tropical Depression Seventeen-E formed September 2 , rapidly intensifying to a tropical storm the next day , then a Category 1 hurricane late that day . Orlene peaked at Category 4 major hurricane status on September 6 . The system held intensity for a day or so , with gradual weakening due to shear over the area , but the shear relaxed over the cyclone early on September 9 , with brought about a quick restrengthening phase on the 9th , although it stopped , and the weakening trend resumed later that day . Orlene weakened back to a tropical storm on September 10 , and finally a depression on September 12 , around the same time that it moved into the Central Pacific . It dissipated two days later , on September 14 , after making landfall as a tropical depression on the Big Island of Hawaii . The remnants caused downpors and washed out roads , and the damage was minimal , though some areas got up to 4 i of rain .\\n On September 5 , a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E . After crossing 140 Â W , the system strengthened into a tropical storm on September 8 and was named Iniki -LRB- Hawaiian word meaning `` strong and piercing wind '' -RRB- In a favorable environment , Iniki intensified into a hurricane on September 9 and a major hurricane the day after . Iniki reached Category 4 intensity early on September 11 .\\n Meanwhile , a series of troughs broke down a ridge over the Hawaiian Islands . This recurved Iniki and accelerated the system northward . Iniki 's eye passed directly over Kauai on September 11 , the first hurricane to make landfall in Hawaii since Hurricane Dot in 1959 . Iniki weakened to a tropical storm and went extratropical on September 13 and was promptly absorbed by a front .\\n At the time , Hurricane Iniki was the costliest Pacific hurricane in recorded history . Damage was heavy on Kauai , with many buildings being unroofed . A total of 1241 houses were completely destroyed . The total cost of damage was 2 billion dollars . Six people died and more than 100 were injured .\\n The tropical wave from which Paine originated moved off the coast of Africa on August 25 , reaching the Caribbean on September 2 , and eventually crossing Central America and the YucatÃ n Peninsula from September 5 to 6 . The wave finally reached the Pacific on the 8th , developing a mid - level circulation a hundred miles or so south of Manzanillo , Mexico . The circulation finally organized enough to be classified as Tropical Depression Nineteen-E early on September 11 , a couple hundred miles southwest of Baja California , while continuing just south of due west for the next couple of days , under the influence of a deep-layer-mean anticyclone . The depression soon intensified into Tropical Storm Paine around 1800 UTC on the September 11 , with Paine gradually reaching its peak intensity of 75 mph -LRB- 120 km\\/h -RRB- , a minimal Category 1 on the 13th , concurrent to the appearance of an eye on satellites . Paine then decelerated to a forward speed of only 2-4 mph , executing a slow , erratic anticyclonic loop for the next three days , and weakening back to a tropical storm by 1800 UTC on the 14th . The loop was initially caused by an approaching trough through the westerlies , but was soon caused by Paine 's proximity to the approaching Hurricane Roslyn from the east . By the 16th , Paine 's weakening structure began to dissipate , and was absorbed into Roslyn 's larger circulation . The merger did n't affect Roslyn 's intensity at all , although a remnant cloud feature persisted within Roslyn 's circulation for another day or so .\\n On September 13 , a tropical wave formed into Tropical Depression Twenty-E , about 360 n south of Baja California . Despite initial disorganization , the system developed an eye-like feature the next day and was named Tropical Storm Roslyn , the storm also began to develop banding features , concurrent with the better establishment of upper-level outflow . Roslyn quickly intensified to just below hurricane status on the September 15 , but began a short weakening trend , as it passed through the wake of Hurricane Paine , where it had begun intensifying on the 11th . By 1800 UTC that day , Roslyn began interacting with the weakening and nearby Paine , with centers of both systems being only a few hundred miles apart , and with this interaction , Paine was absorbed into Roslyn the next day , although this merger did n't affect Roslyn 's intensity in the least . On the September 18 , Roslyn had a brief period of strengthening , On the September 21 , deep convection began to rapidly increase , followed by a visible eye on satellite imagery the next day , which indicated that Roslyn had reached hurricane intensity . The hurricane peaked at moderate Category 2 status later on the September 22 , with a quick decrease in strength thereafter . Roslyn was downgraded to a tropical storm just as it crossed into the Central Pacific two days later , and over the next several days , a trough to the west turned the weakening Roslyn to the northeast , and then to the north . The system finally dissipated on September 30 , over two weeks after it formed .\\n On September 17 , a tropical wave was upgraded into a tropical depression . The next day , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Seymour a couple hundred miles south of the southern tip of Baja California , and while continuing on a west-northwest and northwest track , Seymour reached hurricane strength on the 19th . However , the system soon weakened to a tropical storm , due to the effects of a trough producing moderate shear , and cooler waters . This was short-lived . The trough soon moved out of the area and was replaced by a ridge , which steered Seymour to the west , and allowed it to regain hurricane status on the September 23 , while Seymour had developed a broad and clear eye . However , Seymour only held hurricane intensity for a short period of time , and by that night , it had already weakened back to a tropical storm . After losing a significant amount of deep convection , it weakened to a depression two days later . Tropical Depression Seymour finally dissipated on September 27 . Seymour formed in the open ocean , and it never affected land , as no damage or deaths were reported .\\n Tina was the strongest storm of the season and threatened land for a time . It formed from a tropical wave on September 17 . It moved glacially towards the west and strengthened into a hurricane . A breakdown in a ridge and to the north and a trough then recurved Tina to the northeast and towards land , still moving slowly and gradually slowing down . The trough broke down and was replaced by a strong ridge . Tina then changed direction again and headed out to sea . It intensified into a Category 4 storm with a central pressure of 932 millibars . Tina then slowly weakened as it turned to the north . The stubborn Tropical Depression Tina dissipated on October 11 , shortly after entering the central Pacific .\\n Due to its erratic track and slow motion , Tina was alive from September 17 to October 11 -- a span of 24 days . This is the record for the eastern Pacific Ocean , smashing the east\\/central record of 20 days held by Hurricane Fico in the 1978 season and surpassing Typhoon Rita 's west Pacific 1972 record . It was itself surpassed just two years later by Hurricane John .\\n On September 26 , a tropical depression developed just east of the International Dateline ; however , it was warned upon by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center rather than the Central Pacific Hurricane Center as it was expected to become a significant tropical cyclone outside of the CPHC 's area of responsibility . Just prior to crossing into the Western Pacific basin , it reached tropical storm intensity , at which time it was given the name Ward from the list of Pacific typhoon names . Winds at this time were estimated at 40 mph -LRB- 65 km\\/h -RRB- ; the Japan Meteorological Agency reported the system to have also attained a pressure of 1002 mbar -LRB- hPa ; 29.59 inHg -RRB- . Over the following days , Ward gradually intensified , peaking as a Category 2 storm with winds of 110 mph -LRB- 175 km\\/h -RRB- . The storm eventually weakened as it moved through higher latitudes , becoming extratropical on October 7 over open waters .\\n On October 1 , a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Twenty Three-E , a few hundred miles south of the Mexican coast . Despite weak shearing over the system , it became Tropical Storm Virgil later that day , rapidly intensifying to a hurricane on the October 2 , when a distinct and well defined eye appeared on satellite images . Virgil was originally on a slow northwest track , but a mid-upper level trough turned the hurricane to the north early on the 3rd . Despite the change in track , the hurricane reached a peak at minimal Category 4 status around the same time that it turned to the north that day . Virgil continued north until early on the 4th , when it turned to the northwest and made landfall at high Category 2 strength , halfway between Manzanillo and LÃ zaro CÃ rdenas , and after landfall , the system was quickly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico , passing to the north of Manzanillo late on the October 4 . Shortly after passing over Manzanillo , it weakened below tropical storm strength , and early on the 5th , the weakened Tropical Depression Virgil exited into the Pacific , but no regeneration was expected , as strong westerlies and the weakened state of the system prevented any regeneration , and it dissipated shortly thereafter .\\n Because Virgil made landfall in a sparsely populated area , damage from storm surge was minimal . The chief effect was heavy rain and flooding , peaking at over 10 i in one location .\\n An area of disturbed weather developed into Tropical Depression Twenty Four-E a few hundred miles south of Acapulco . The next day , it developed into Tropical Storm Winifred , while satellites began showing increased convective banding features around the storm 's center . Winifred was upgraded to a hurricane on the 8th , an eye soon appeared on satellite imagery , with the system 's outer rainbands affecting Mexico 's southwest coast that day . Winifred peaked at Category 3 status the next day , turning to the north-northeast just hours before landfall at Category 2 strength , but the eye had disappeared hours prior to landfall , which was an indication of Winifred weakening to Category 2 strength . It rapidly weakened to a depression over the mountainous terrain of Mexico by October 10 , while continuing on a northeast track and finally degenerating to a remnant low later that day .\\n Three people were killed by floods . Damage was concentrated in Colima and MichoacÃ n. Electricity and water systems was knocked out in Colima .\\n On October 13 , a tropical wave developed a visible low level circulation center , developing into Tropical Depression Twenty Five-E later that day , several hundred miles south of Baja California . The system quickly reached tropical storm status , while moving west at about 14 m. On the 17th , Xavier dissipated several hundred miles south of the tip of Baja California , the remnants were tracked for several days , until it moved out of range of available satellites . Xavier was only the second tropical system to be named with an ` X ' in the eastern Pacific basin , after 1985 's Xina . Xavier formed at sea , and therefore , no deaths or damages are associated with it .\\n On October 15 a tropical depression formed from the wave several hundred miles south of Manzanillo , and on the 16th , it strengthened into Tropical Storm Yolanda . The storm turned to the northwest later that day , and maintained this track for the rest of its lifespan . Yolanda peaked as a strong tropical storm on the 19th , but strong southwesterly shear removed all deep convection within the storm 's circulation later that day , although there were several occasional flare-ups of convection for the next 12 hours or so . The storm weakened back to a depression the next day , while steering currents moved the weakening depression 's center to the southwest , and then finally the west before dissipating in the Central Pacific on the October 22 . Due to the fact that it formed at sea , no deaths or damages are associated with the storm .\\n On the October 25 , a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Twenty Seven-E several hundred miles south of Baja California . It became Tropical Storm Zeke the next day , concurrent to developing banding features as well as good upper level outflow . A mid-upper level trough approached the west coast of the United States , which induced strong shear over the storm , separating deep convection from the center , and it was downgraded to depression status on the 27th . However , the trough also forced Zeke north , then northeast , which resulted in the shear weakening , allowing it to re-develop , and the system was again upgraded to tropical storm status . Zeke reached peak intensity on the October 29 , while on course for a potential landfall in Baja California . Despite reaching peak intensity , new westerlies spread over Zeke , which rapidly weakened the system , eventually dissipating on October 30 .\\n Although the 1991 -- 1992 El Nino season had ended in the Central Pacific , sea surface temperatures in the basin remained high into November . Due to the high temperatures , cloudiness and showers persisted south of Hawaii . Around November 22 , a disturbance formed within a cloud mass south of the Hawaiian Islands . The system then developed a closed circulation , being upgraded to Tropical Depression Three-C on November 22 . The depression did not strengthen further , dissipating 24 hours later about 670 m south of the Hawaiian Islands .\\n This is a table of the storms in 1992 and their landfall -LRB- s -RRB- , if any . Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect -LRB- an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident -RRB- , but are still storm-related . Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or low .\\n The table below shows the ACE for each storm in the season . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots -LRB- 39 mph , 63 km\\/h -RRB- or tropical storm strength . The figures in parenthesis are for storms in the Central Pacific basin west of 140 Â W ; those not in parenthesis are for the Eastern Pacific basin . This season had the highest ACE of any season on record , with an overall value of 295.492 . The 1990 season also had a high ACE , at about 250 that year , but only about 4 of that was from the central Pacific . 33.34 of this seasons total ace came from the central Pacific ; excluding it , the overall ace was 262.152 . The 1990 season had 6 less storms than this year , but because 16 of the 21 storms that year became hurricanes -LRB- the record for any season -RRB- , and the fact that the major hurricanes in 1990 , like Hernan and Trudy , were stronger than this year 's ones , the 1990 season 's ACE was only 12 lower than this season , so this season had a higher ACE than 1990 , but the average ACE per storm that year was higher than this year .\\n The cumulative ACE for the Eastern Pacific this season fell within the official `` Near Normal '' grading , even though the number of tropical storms , hurricanes , and major hurricanes was well above the long term average .\\n The following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 1992 . No eastern Pacific names were retired , so it was used again in the 1998 season . This is the same list used for the 1986 season . Storms were named Seymour , Tina , Virgil , Winifred , Xavier , Yolanda , and Zeke for the first time in 1992 . Yolanda and Zeke were the first time that Y and Z names had been used to name storms .\\n All names on the list were used this year . This is the second time that a northeast Pacific hurricane season had exhausted its list . The 1983 season also used every name on its list , but the list only went to the W name at the time . The 1985 season 's list was lengthened while it was going on to prevent exhaustion .\\n Three names from the central Pacific list were used - Ekeka , Hali , and Iniki . This was the first usage for all of these names .\\n One name was retired from the Central Pacific list after the 1992 season : Iniki . It was replaced with Iolana . Later , in 2006 , a name change for various Central Pacific names took place and a second name was removed : Hali . It was replaced by Hene .</td>\n",

       "      <td>The 1992 Pacific hurricane season was the most active Pacific season on record . The most notable storm was Hurricane Iniki , which caused billions of dollars of damage to the Hawaiian Islands . Hurricanes Lester , Virgil , Winifred , and Orlene also made landfall and killed several people , but were significantly less destructive . Hurricane Darby and Tropical Storm Agatha brought rains and more destruction to Mexico , without making landfall . Also of note are Hurricane Ekeka and Tropical Storm Hali , which formed in late January and March , respectively .</td>\n",

       "12  The 1992 Pacific hurricane season was the most active Pacific hurricane season on record . The most notable storm was Hurricane Iniki , which caused billions of dollars of damage to the Hawaiian Islands . Hurricanes Lester , Virgil , Winifred , and Orlene also made landfall and killed several people , but were significantly less destructive . Hurricane Darby and Tropical Storm Agatha brought rains and more destruction to Mexico , without making landfall . Hurricane Tina was the longest-lasting Pacific hurricane at the time . Also of note are Hurricane Ekeka and Tropical Storm Hali , which formed in late January and late March , respectively .\\n The season officially started on May 15 , 1992 in the Eastern Pacific , and on June 1 , 1992 in the central Pacific , and lasted until November 30 , 1992 . These dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern and north-central Pacific Ocean . However , the season wildly exceeded these bounds , as climatological effects including an El NiÃ o caused Hurricane Ekeka to form on January 26 . Ekeka 's formation marks a record for the earliest formation of a tropical cyclone in either the Eastern or Central Pacific basins . It is also the only known time that multiple cyclones had formed before the season began .\\n During the season , twenty-seven tropical cyclones formed in the Eastern Pacific -LRB- east of longitude 140 Â W -RRB- , and twenty-four underwent further cyclogenesis to become tropical storms . Both of these figures constitute records in the basin , as the 1992 season surpassed the season with the most tropical cyclones -LRB- 1982 , 26 -RRB- and the season with the most named storms -LRB- 1985 , 22 -RRB- . Of these , fourteen reached hurricane strength and eight became major hurricaneâ '' storms that reach Category 3 or higher on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Scale .\\n This season had five storms reach tropical storm intensity or higher in the month of October , the only time that had happened in this basin . In addition , Hurricanes or Tropical Storms Winifred through Zeke are the earliest twenty-first through twenty-fourth named storms in a season in the eastern north Pacific .\\n The Central Pacific -LRB- between 140 Â W and the International Date Line -RRB- saw similarly high levels of activity . Eleven tropical cyclones were tracked by the Central Pacific Hurricane Center throughout the hurricane season . Of those , eight developed in the Eastern Pacific and crossed into the Central Pacific , and three formed within the basin . Two of the storms strengthened to major hurricane status within the Central Pacific 's boundaries .\\n One of the crossover storms , Iniki , crossed into the basin as a tropical depression , strengthened to a Category 4 hurricane , and made landfall in Hawaii , becoming the most destructive hurricane in the state 's history .\\n Ekeka , the first storm of the season , developed from an area of disturbed weather near Kiritimati in the Line Islands . The tropical disturbance had been tracked since January 23 , and at 0600 UTC January 28 , the Central Pacific Hurricane Center determined that the area had met the meteorological characteristics of a tropical depression , and designated the system as Tropical Depression One-C . This was unusual , since the system was located well to the south of the area of normal tropical cyclone formation , further south than any other Pacific hurricane , and the formation occurred well outside the climatological bounds of the hurricane season . The system intesified and reached tropical storm status 12 hours later , at which point it became known as Ekeka .\\n The system continued intensifying until reaching hurricane status at 0000 UTC on January 30 , and it reached major hurricane status on February 2 , reaching maximum sustained winds of 115 mph -LRB- 185 km\\/h -RRB- and a minimum central barometric pressure of 985 mbar -LRB- hPa ; 29.09 inHg -RRB- . However , unfavorable wind shear began taking a toll on the storm , causing it to rapidly weaken . Ekeka crossed the International Date Line as a weakened tropical storm , and shortly thereafter degraded to tropical depression status . Ekeka continued westward , passing through the Marshall Islands and later over Chuuk , before dissipating on February 9 about 310 mi -LRB- 500 km -RRB- off the north coast of Papua New Guinea . The storm did not cause any significant damage or deaths .\\n The history set by Hurricane Ekeka repeated itself when , on March 28 , another low-latitude area of thunderstorms organized into Tropical Depression Two-C , just north of 5 Ë N , atypically close to the equator . The next day , it intensified into a tropical storm and received the name Hali , which is Hawaiian for Holly . The tropical storm reached its peak intensity on March 29 , packing sustained winds of 50 mph -LRB- 85 km\\/h -RRB- . Almost immediately thereafter , wind shear blew away the top of the system and caused it to fall apart . The Central Pacific Hurricane Center declared the system dissipated on March 30 .\\n Tropical Storm Hali had no impact on land . However , it is also a meteorological enigma , as it is the only known Pacific tropical cyclone east of the dateline to develop in the month of March .\\n A tropical wave that entered the Pacific in late May organized into Tropical Depression One-E on June 1 . It moved north for the next two days . The depression strengthened into a tropical storm on June 2 . After peaking the same day , Agatha slowed down and started drifting west . It steadily weakened , falling to a depression on June 5 . Agatha had dissipated by the next day . Agatha approached close enough to the coast of Mexico that watches and warnings were issued .\\n An estimated 1,500 people were evacuated due to the storms ' approach . Waves up to 16 f were reported along the coast of Mexico and torrential rains triggered flash flooding resulting in ten fatalities .\\n A tropical depression formed near 114 Â W on June 16 . The system moved west for a short time , reaching a peak intensity 1009 mbar and maximum sustained winds of 35 m. It dissipated , without strengthening , on June 19 .\\n A tropical wave crossed over Dakar , Africa on June 4 and passed the Cape Verde Islands the next day . The wave continued westward and on June 10 , passed the Windward Islands . The wave went through Central America during the period of June 14 and June 16 . The system entered the Eastern Pacific basin without gaining much convection . Over waters marginally suitable for cyclogenesis , a tropical wave organized into the second depression of the season on June 22 . It briefly reached tropical storm strength on June 23 . It then moved over cooler waters and dissipated the next day . Blas did not have any impact on land masses .\\n Celia 's origin as a tropical wave on June 8 off the coast of Africa . The system moved toward Central America and crossed over into the East Pacific basin around the 19th . The NHC declared the wave as a tropical depression on June 22 farther east than usual due to the low vertical wind shear . The NHC declared it as a tropical storm on the 23rd and was given the name Celia . Soon afterward , Celia started strengthening and soon became a hurricane . Celia started deepening rapidly starting around June 26 and soon became a Category 4 major hurricane with winds of 125 k and a minimal pressure of 935 mbar . Celia maintained Category 4 intensity for about 24 hours and then started to gradually weaken . Celia fell below hurricane status on July 2 and to tropical depression status the next day . Thereafter , all that was left of Celia was a swirl of low-convection clouds and was impossible to recognize on July 4 .\\n A tropical wave organized into tropical depression Five-E on July 2 . It strengthened and was named Darby the next day . Steering currents became very strong , and Darby accelerated as it paralleled the coast of Mexico . It strengthened into a hurricane on July 5 and also substantially increased in size . It peaked as a strong Category 3 on July 6 . Darby began to substantially weaken thereafter as it passed over cooler waters . The hurricane weakened into a storm and then a depression on July 8 and July 9 , respectively . Tropical Depression Darby lost tropical characteristics the next day . Moisture from the hurricane eventually spread over parts of the Continental United States .\\n During Darby 's formation , flooding from the cyclone 's rainbands killed three people in Acapulco , where 180 shops were damaged . Four fishermen were reported missing , fate unknown . Manzanillo , Colima , reported sustained winds just above tropical-storm force . The hurricane 's remnants brought mainly light rain to the U.S. state of California . Cloud cover also delayed the landing of the Space Shuttle Columbia for one day . South-facing beaches of that state were pounded with waves up to 7 feet -LRB- 2.3 m -RRB- in height . A monetary value for damage is not available .\\n Darby also caused a few shipping accidents . A pleasure craft , the Oasis , had an engine failure and was abandoned . The seven people aboard were rescued , but the boat was sunk . A smaller sailboat , the Hosanna , had difficulties but was towed to a safe location by a cutter from the United States Coast Guard . A fishing boat at an unspecified location also experienced difficulties .\\n The origin of Hurricane Estelle is unclear . The National Hurricane Center indicates that it may have formed from a tropical wave that began on June 23 off the African coast . The wave began to move at low latitudes and passed the northern part of South America . On July 2 , deep convection began to join with the wave as it crossed into the eastern Pacific Ocean on July 7 . Reports indicate that the wave strengthened into Tropical Depression Six-E on July 9 . Eighteen hours later , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Estelle in unusually strong shear . The shear began to weaken and an eye began to form within Estelle 's circulation on July 11 . The eye formation caused the NHC to upgrade Estelle to a minimal hurricane .\\n From early July 11 to late July 15 , Estelle moved at about 7 - 15 m to the northwest . During this period , Estelle reached 140 m winds and became a Category 4 hurricane . The system weakened gradually and by July 17 , Estelle had completely lost its tropical characteristics . The hurricane did not affect any land in its lifetime , thus no damage was reported .\\n Frank was a long lived major hurricane . A tropical wave became Tropical Depression Seven-E on July 13 . It strengthened into a tropical storm and was named Frank on July 14 . It became a hurricane the next day . After peaking as a Category 4 storm it entered cold water on July 18 and weakened to a tropical storm on July 21 and degenerated to a low on July 23 .\\n A tropical wave left Africa in early July and crossed the Atlantic , with no development whatsoever in that basin and crossed into the eastern Pacific , eventually organizing itself into Tropical Depression Eight-E on July 14 . It became a tropical storm the next day and was named Georgette by the NHC . Georgette quickly organized into a minimal hurricane 18 hours later . On the 18th , Georgette strengthened quickly to reach a peak of 110 mph -LRB- 175 km\\/h -RRB- and a minimum pressure of 964 mbar . It then began to weaken and eventually dissipated on July 26 southwest of Hawaii without ever making landfall .\\n On July 26 a tropical depression formed and became a weak tropical storm the next day . It steadily organized , ad reached it peak intensity as a strong tropical storm . It then began to weaken , despite being located over warm waters . Howard dissipated several days later without affecting land .\\n Isis formed on July 28 as a depression and became a tropical storm the next day . Isis peaked as a strong tropical storm with 65 m winds on July 30 . Due to cooler water , it weakened to a depression on the first and dissipated the next day . Isis degenerated to an broad area of low pressure on August 2 .\\n Javier formed from a tropical wave that left Africa on July 17 . It organized into Tropical Depression Eleven-E on July 30 . It became a tropical storm four days later later and was named Javier . After peaking as a minimal hurricane , Javier dissipated on August 12 . No fatalities or damage was reported .\\n Twelve-E had a peak windspeed of 35 mph -LRB- 55 km -RRB- , and a pressure of 1008 mb . It formed August 10 , and dissipated August 12 .\\n A depression formed on August 18 . It became a tropical storm shortly after forming and was named Kay . Kay was a short lived system . Its peak intensity was only 50 m. However , Kay was a very small tropical storm . It dissipated on August 22 . Kay never impacted anyone .\\n Lester was the first actual landfall of the Eastern Pacific season . The hurricane first made landfall in Baja California Peninsula on the August 23 , striking mainland Mexico late that day . Accelerating northeast , Lester entered the U.S. state of Arizona as a tropical storm and New Mexico as a tropical depression before ejecting out into the Plains .\\n No deaths were reported . Lester left over 5000 people homeless . Several tiny settlements west of Hermosillo , Sonora , and on a highway to San Diego , California , were destroyed . A ship called the Gladiator rolled over 33 degrees to both starboard and port , spilling a considerable amount of cargo .\\n Far in the open ocean , a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Fifteen-E on August 27 . Banding and convection increased , and the depression became a tropical storm the next day . Development continued , and Madeline peaked with a minimum pressure of 999 mb , and winds of 45 k , on August 29 . As the system progressed westward , it entered a region of strong wind shear and had dissipated on August 31 . The system never came near land .\\n Newton was fairly short-lived storm . It formed from a tropical wave on August 27 . It became a tropical storm , was named Newton 18 hours later , and dissipated four days later on August 31 . Newton never impacted any land .\\n Tropical Depression Seventeen-E formed September 2 , rapidly intensifying to a tropical storm the next day , then a Category 1 hurricane late that day . Orlene peaked at Category 4 major hurricane status on September 6 . The system held intensity for a day or so , with gradual weakening due to shear over the area , but the shear relaxed over the cyclone early on September 9 , with brought about a quick restrengthening phase on the 9th , although it stopped , and the weakening trend resumed later that day . Orlene weakened back to a tropical storm on September 10 , and finally a depression on September 12 , around the same time that it moved into the Central Pacific . It dissipated two days later , on September 14 , after making landfall as a tropical depression on the Big Island of Hawaii . The remnants caused downpors and washed out roads , and the damage was minimal , though some areas got up to 4 i of rain .\\n On September 5 , a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Eighteen-E . After crossing 140 Â W , the system strengthened into a tropical storm on September 8 and was named Iniki -LRB- Hawaiian word meaning `` strong and piercing wind '' -RRB- In a favorable environment , Iniki intensified into a hurricane on September 9 and a major hurricane the day after . Iniki reached Category 4 intensity early on September 11 .\\n Meanwhile , a series of troughs broke down a ridge over the Hawaiian Islands . This recurved Iniki and accelerated the system northward . Iniki 's eye passed directly over Kauai on September 11 , the first hurricane to make landfall in Hawaii since Hurricane Dot in 1959 . Iniki weakened to a tropical storm and went extratropical on September 13 and was promptly absorbed by a front .\\n At the time , Hurricane Iniki was the costliest Pacific hurricane in recorded history . Damage was heavy on Kauai , with many buildings being unroofed . A total of 1241 houses were completely destroyed . The total cost of damage was 2 billion dollars . Six people died and more than 100 were injured .\\n The tropical wave from which Paine originated moved off the coast of Africa on August 25 , reaching the Caribbean on September 2 , and eventually crossing Central America and the YucatÃ n Peninsula from September 5 to 6 . The wave finally reached the Pacific on the 8th , developing a mid - level circulation a hundred miles or so south of Manzanillo , Mexico . The circulation finally organized enough to be classified as Tropical Depression Nineteen-E early on September 11 , a couple hundred miles southwest of Baja California , while continuing just south of due west for the next couple of days , under the influence of a deep-layer-mean anticyclone . The depression soon intensified into Tropical Storm Paine around 1800 UTC on the September 11 , with Paine gradually reaching its peak intensity of 75 mph -LRB- 120 km\\/h -RRB- , a minimal Category 1 on the 13th , concurrent to the appearance of an eye on satellites . Paine then decelerated to a forward speed of only 2-4 mph , executing a slow , erratic anticyclonic loop for the next three days , and weakening back to a tropical storm by 1800 UTC on the 14th . The loop was initially caused by an approaching trough through the westerlies , but was soon caused by Paine 's proximity to the approaching Hurricane Roslyn from the east . By the 16th , Paine 's weakening structure began to dissipate , and was absorbed into Roslyn 's larger circulation . The merger did n't affect Roslyn 's intensity at all , although a remnant cloud feature persisted within Roslyn 's circulation for another day or so .\\n On September 13 , a tropical wave formed into Tropical Depression Twenty-E , about 360 n south of Baja California . Despite initial disorganization , the system developed an eye-like feature the next day and was named Tropical Storm Roslyn , the storm also began to develop banding features , concurrent with the better establishment of upper-level outflow . Roslyn quickly intensified to just below hurricane status on the September 15 , but began a short weakening trend , as it passed through the wake of Hurricane Paine , where it had begun intensifying on the 11th . By 1800 UTC that day , Roslyn began interacting with the weakening and nearby Paine , with centers of both systems being only a few hundred miles apart , and with this interaction , Paine was absorbed into Roslyn the next day , although this merger did n't affect Roslyn 's intensity in the least . On the September 18 , Roslyn had a brief period of strengthening , On the September 21 , deep convection began to rapidly increase , followed by a visible eye on satellite imagery the next day , which indicated that Roslyn had reached hurricane intensity . The hurricane peaked at moderate Category 2 status later on the September 22 , with a quick decrease in strength thereafter . Roslyn was downgraded to a tropical storm just as it crossed into the Central Pacific two days later , and over the next several days , a trough to the west turned the weakening Roslyn to the northeast , and then to the north . The system finally dissipated on September 30 , over two weeks after it formed .\\n On September 17 , a tropical wave was upgraded into a tropical depression . The next day , the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Seymour a couple hundred miles south of the southern tip of Baja California , and while continuing on a west-northwest and northwest track , Seymour reached hurricane strength on the 19th . However , the system soon weakened to a tropical storm , due to the effects of a trough producing moderate shear , and cooler waters . This was short-lived . The trough soon moved out of the area and was replaced by a ridge , which steered Seymour to the west , and allowed it to regain hurricane status on the September 23 , while Seymour had developed a broad and clear eye . However , Seymour only held hurricane intensity for a short period of time , and by that night , it had already weakened back to a tropical storm . After losing a significant amount of deep convection , it weakened to a depression two days later . Tropical Depression Seymour finally dissipated on September 27 . Seymour formed in the open ocean , and it never affected land , as no damage or deaths were reported .\\n Tina was the strongest storm of the season and threatened land for a time . It formed from a tropical wave on September 17 . It moved glacially towards the west and strengthened into a hurricane . A breakdown in a ridge and to the north and a trough then recurved Tina to the northeast and towards land , still moving slowly and gradually slowing down . The trough broke down and was replaced by a strong ridge . Tina then changed direction again and headed out to sea . It intensified into a Category 4 storm with a central pressure of 932 millibars . Tina then slowly weakened as it turned to the north . The stubborn Tropical Depression Tina dissipated on October 11 , shortly after entering the central Pacific .\\n Due to its erratic track and slow motion , Tina was alive from September 17 to October 11 -- a span of 24 days . This is the record for the eastern Pacific Ocean , smashing the east\\/central record of 20 days held by Hurricane Fico in the 1978 season and surpassing Typhoon Rita 's west Pacific 1972 record . It was itself surpassed just two years later by Hurricane John .\\n On September 26 , a tropical depression developed just east of the International Dateline ; however , it was warned upon by the Joint Typhoon Warning Center rather than the Central Pacific Hurricane Center as it was expected to become a significant tropical cyclone outside of the CPHC 's area of responsibility . Just prior to crossing into the Western Pacific basin , it reached tropical storm intensity , at which time it was given the name Ward from the list of Pacific typhoon names . Winds at this time were estimated at 40 mph -LRB- 65 km\\/h -RRB- ; the Japan Meteorological Agency reported the system to have also attained a pressure of 1002 mbar -LRB- hPa ; 29.59 inHg -RRB- . Over the following days , Ward gradually intensified , peaking as a Category 2 storm with winds of 110 mph -LRB- 175 km\\/h -RRB- . The storm eventually weakened as it moved through higher latitudes , becoming extratropical on October 7 over open waters .\\n On October 1 , a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Twenty Three-E , a few hundred miles south of the Mexican coast . Despite weak shearing over the system , it became Tropical Storm Virgil later that day , rapidly intensifying to a hurricane on the October 2 , when a distinct and well defined eye appeared on satellite images . Virgil was originally on a slow northwest track , but a mid-upper level trough turned the hurricane to the north early on the 3rd . Despite the change in track , the hurricane reached a peak at minimal Category 4 status around the same time that it turned to the north that day . Virgil continued north until early on the 4th , when it turned to the northwest and made landfall at high Category 2 strength , halfway between Manzanillo and LÃ zaro CÃ rdenas , and after landfall , the system was quickly weakened over the mountainous terrain of Mexico , passing to the north of Manzanillo late on the October 4 . Shortly after passing over Manzanillo , it weakened below tropical storm strength , and early on the 5th , the weakened Tropical Depression Virgil exited into the Pacific , but no regeneration was expected , as strong westerlies and the weakened state of the system prevented any regeneration , and it dissipated shortly thereafter .\\n Because Virgil made landfall in a sparsely populated area , damage from storm surge was minimal . The chief effect was heavy rain and flooding , peaking at over 10 i in one location .\\n An area of disturbed weather developed into Tropical Depression Twenty Four-E a few hundred miles south of Acapulco . The next day , it developed into Tropical Storm Winifred , while satellites began showing increased convective banding features around the storm 's center . Winifred was upgraded to a hurricane on the 8th , an eye soon appeared on satellite imagery , with the system 's outer rainbands affecting Mexico 's southwest coast that day . Winifred peaked at Category 3 status the next day , turning to the north-northeast just hours before landfall at Category 2 strength , but the eye had disappeared hours prior to landfall , which was an indication of Winifred weakening to Category 2 strength . It rapidly weakened to a depression over the mountainous terrain of Mexico by October 10 , while continuing on a northeast track and finally degenerating to a remnant low later that day .\\n Three people were killed by floods . Damage was concentrated in Colima and MichoacÃ n. Electricity and water systems was knocked out in Colima .\\n On October 13 , a tropical wave developed a visible low level circulation center , developing into Tropical Depression Twenty Five-E later that day , several hundred miles south of Baja California . The system quickly reached tropical storm status , while moving west at about 14 m. On the 17th , Xavier dissipated several hundred miles south of the tip of Baja California , the remnants were tracked for several days , until it moved out of range of available satellites . Xavier was only the second tropical system to be named with an ` X ' in the eastern Pacific basin , after 1985 's Xina . Xavier formed at sea , and therefore , no deaths or damages are associated with it .\\n On October 15 a tropical depression formed from the wave several hundred miles south of Manzanillo , and on the 16th , it strengthened into Tropical Storm Yolanda . The storm turned to the northwest later that day , and maintained this track for the rest of its lifespan . Yolanda peaked as a strong tropical storm on the 19th , but strong southwesterly shear removed all deep convection within the storm 's circulation later that day , although there were several occasional flare-ups of convection for the next 12 hours or so . The storm weakened back to a depression the next day , while steering currents moved the weakening depression 's center to the southwest , and then finally the west before dissipating in the Central Pacific on the October 22 . Due to the fact that it formed at sea , no deaths or damages are associated with the storm .\\n On the October 25 , a tropical wave organized into Tropical Depression Twenty Seven-E several hundred miles south of Baja California . It became Tropical Storm Zeke the next day , concurrent to developing banding features as well as good upper level outflow . A mid-upper level trough approached the west coast of the United States , which induced strong shear over the storm , separating deep convection from the center , and it was downgraded to depression status on the 27th . However , the trough also forced Zeke north , then northeast , which resulted in the shear weakening , allowing it to re-develop , and the system was again upgraded to tropical storm status . Zeke reached peak intensity on the October 29 , while on course for a potential landfall in Baja California . Despite reaching peak intensity , new westerlies spread over Zeke , which rapidly weakened the system , eventually dissipating on October 30 .\\n Although the 1991 -- 1992 El Nino season had ended in the Central Pacific , sea surface temperatures in the basin remained high into November . Due to the high temperatures , cloudiness and showers persisted south of Hawaii . Around November 22 , a disturbance formed within a cloud mass south of the Hawaiian Islands . The system then developed a closed circulation , being upgraded to Tropical Depression Three-C on November 22 . The depression did not strengthen further , dissipating 24 hours later about 670 m south of the Hawaiian Islands .\\n This is a table of the storms in 1992 and their landfall -LRB- s -RRB- , if any . Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect -LRB- an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident -RRB- , but are still storm-related . Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical or a wave or low .\\n The table below shows the ACE for each storm in the season . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots -LRB- 39 mph , 63 km\\/h -RRB- or tropical storm strength . The figures in parenthesis are for storms in the Central Pacific basin west of 140 Â W ; those not in parenthesis are for the Eastern Pacific basin . This season had the highest ACE of any season on record , with an overall value of 295.492 . The 1990 season also had a high ACE , at about 250 that year , but only about 4 of that was from the central Pacific . 33.34 of this seasons total ace came from the central Pacific ; excluding it , the overall ace was 262.152 . The 1990 season had 6 less storms than this year , but because 16 of the 21 storms that year became hurricanes -LRB- the record for any season -RRB- , and the fact that the major hurricanes in 1990 , like Hernan and Trudy , were stronger than this year 's ones , the 1990 season 's ACE was only 12 lower than this season , so this season had a higher ACE than 1990 , but the average ACE per storm that year was higher than this year .\\n The cumulative ACE for the Eastern Pacific this season fell within the official `` Near Normal '' grading , even though the number of tropical storms , hurricanes , and major hurricanes was well above the long term average .\\n The following names were used for named storms that formed in the northeast Pacific in 1992 . No eastern Pacific names were retired , so it was used again in the 1998 season . This is the same list used for the 1986 season . Storms were named Seymour , Tina , Virgil , Winifred , Xavier , Yolanda , and Zeke for the first time in 1992 . Yolanda and Zeke were the first time that Y and Z names had been used to name storms .\\n All names on the list were used this year . This is the second time that a northeast Pacific hurricane season had exhausted its list . The 1983 season also used every name on its list , but the list only went to the W name at the time . The 1985 season 's list was lengthened while it was going on to prevent exhaustion .\\n Three names from the central Pacific list were used - Ekeka , Hali , and Iniki . This was the first usage for all of these names .\\n One name was retired from the Central Pacific list after the 1992 season : Iniki . It was replaced with Iolana . Later , in 2006 , a name change for various Central Pacific names took place and a second name was removed : Hali . It was replaced by Hene .   \n",

             The 1992 Pacific hurricane season was the most active Pacific season on record . The most notable storm was Hurricane Iniki , which caused billions of dollars of damage to the Hawaiian Islands . Hurricanes Lester , Virgil , Winifred , and Orlene also made landfall and killed several people , but were significantly less destructive . Hurricane Darby and Tropical Storm Agatha brought rains and more destruction to Mexico , without making landfall . Also of note are Hurricane Ekeka and Tropical Storm Hali , which formed in late January and March , respectively .   \n",
