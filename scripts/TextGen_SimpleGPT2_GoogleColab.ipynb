particulates but also to keep the soil adiabatic. \n","It is also more efficient, since we can now increase the amount of light carried by two motors through the air, which works in the same way in a wind farm. One motor produces the speed of sound, the other extracts energy, then passes it to the camera mounted on the back of the windmilling tent. \n","In the end, it all comes down to the right amount of light, so the project started with an estimate of £100,000. It was all taken together by a group of volunteers. \n","The windmills we have in Srinagar are built using a mixture of solar and windmilling technology. There have been demonstrations about solar power at Srinagar's mosques in recent years, but this was a new project, with very different results. The project was unsuccessful but now, with the amount of renewable energy being pumped towards the buildings from solar power being cut to zero, the project can go ahead. \n","The project has a good track record but it is slow. It uses a lot of water and therefore has no windmills. Another great advantage would be the improved battery life. A typical 24kg bottle of windmills costs about £400 to £500 and this will make use of the windmills more reliable. \n","It started with some questions. What is the ideal range of a wind farm to create an effective windscreen? What are the costs of achieving it? There were several difficulties. The first was creating a clear sky – not the darker sky from a wind farm that often obscures parts of India and Pakistan, however dark we may be. The question was whether we were going to get a wind farm with multiple wind farms and one big windfield. The windmills were all in Srinagar and they all looked like they could do better than Srinagar with a background of clean wind and green spaces. \n","The second problem, with solar panels, was figuring out the optimum temperature range for a solar farm. At 3,000°C the panels were all in place and at 5,000°C the wind had moved very slowly. This is not an issue with windmills though. The range of the solar farm is much higher at 5,000°C and the highest at 4,000°C. This helped save money on the project but is now an issue with a more efficient motor. \n","But, as the wind was still blowing, it was clear there was an opportunity. A team of about three archaeologists took the site and, along the banks of the Ganga, a team of volunteers explored the excavation site, working with students and family. \n","“To get to the surface, we needed to do more than just dig. We needed to dig slowly – the best depth we found was only two metres, or ten or twenty metres, so we need to do it slowly, slowly, efficiently” says Srinagar historian Sajid Al-Rashid. “The team managed to squeeze in 20-30 diggers every day – they did their job well and kept people coming.” \n","With only around 200 digging sites around the world, Srinagar has one of the highest densities in the city, with around 200 families with four or five neighbours. One digger takes three to four hours, while the others work only 14 hours a day. \n","The excavations at Srinagar started in April 2013. The team of three spent three weeks removing sand, gravel and mud. They then cut a straight wall of rubble from the site by hand. \n","“The whole project starts out with a bucket, bucket and a tarp, then another excavation, then a full excavation so we can start to see more, deeper and to see where the mud meets the new sand. Then, I go to the site, check the mortar and the insides, fill all the foundations and put bricks in the foundations, as well as any structural support, then cover this and every other part of the site with an inter-mineral framework.” \n","The excavation is ongoing and the team is waiting to see how they go about it. \n","<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>Why do so much of our public money is spent on things that we only see inside prisons and not in other prisons?

These false memories are thought to operate in concert with individual brain networks. \n","These networks, which process tiny signals from the words on a computer screen, could enable a new, if elusive, way to test how memory is encoded in the brains of people. Memories of events or even the actual experience of them may be destroyed by manipulating individual brain cells, the researchers said. \n","These individual brain tumour tumour tumour cells produce a fear response similar to a kind of spike in the cerebral cortex. When these tumour cells fear a particular word or experience, they release a chemical protein that produces fear. These individual brain tumour tumours produce an electrical charge around the brain and this current violently attacks them. \n","When the false memories of those implanted in mice were destroyed, the same processes happened. “Injecting a false memory at once produced such a wide electrical field around the brain that we could observe the field as a whole,” Kamran Loghman, a neuroscientist at Oxford University, told the Guardian. He told the team that the technique could be used to study the brain responses to fear. \n","Memory implantation isn’t as simple as smashing the memory into the memory shield – the key is being able to implant the memory in the right person and in the right environment. His lab at Oxford is attempting to develop a model that would allow scientists to study how individual cells individually process the memory. \n","The method has already been used to study how our brain works in the lab. In one experiment, Loghman and his colleagues exposed brain cells to a series of steady brain waves. They were then told to hold the wave in a specific place, then drop it. This gave rise to what they called a false memory. \n","The team put the false memory into two groups – one group received the light, which they hoped would lead to a treatment or cure of their disease, while the other received a placebo wave. In both experiments, the false memory group were right in their tumour and loved one, but the willing recipient wave group were wrong in their tumour. In both experiments, the false memory group were correctly located just above the targeted brain spot. In one important demonstration, the false memory was able to fool brain scanners and create false memories in half the time.\n","<|endoftext|>\n","<|startoftext|>The world shares him and London claims him but Stratford-upon-Avon intends to spend 2016 celebrating Shakespeare as their patron saint.

He added: “The dignity of the office I possess in is, of course, that of a king’s deputy; but I cannot imagine that a public career in the public courts could be better spent than that of a king’s deputy.” \n","Macbeth was the first of Shakespeare’s plays to be written. The second took place a decade and a half after Shakespeare’s death. The play received wide acceptance in Stratford, including awards for best play and most performances. \n","The second play, a response to the first, is an urgent reconstruction of Macbeth from the poem Macbeth Besieged, first published in 4BC after Macbeth’s sister, a sister, died. It is now part of the second volume of The Tempest, a three-part drama written by Paul Schrader and directed by Guillaume Couture. It is scheduled to be released in 2017 by Warner Bros. \n","Stratford has heard\n","\n","[610 | 798.64] loss=0.58 avg=1.54\n","[620 | 811.13] loss=0.69 avg=1.52\n","[630 | 823.61] loss=0.54 avg=1.50\n","[640 | 836.10] loss=0.54 avg=1.48\n","[650 | 848.59] loss=0.40 avg=1.46\n","[660 | 861.09] loss=0.35 avg=1.44\n","[670 | 873.57] loss=0.44 avg=1.42\n","[680 | 886.08] loss=0.37 avg=1.39\n","[690 | 898.59] loss=0.58 avg=1.38\n","[700 | 911.06] loss=0.52 avg=1.36\n","[710 | 923.55] loss=0.55 avg=1.35\n","[720 | 936.05] loss=0.57 avg=1.33\n","[730 | 948.54] loss=0.39 avg=1.31\n","[740 | 961.03] loss=0.37 avg=1.29\n","[750 | 973.53] loss=0.56 avg=1.28\n","[760 | 986.01] loss=0.38 avg=1.26\n","[770 | 998.51] loss=0.47 avg=1.25\n","[780 | 1011.00] loss=0.42 avg=1.23\n","[790 | 1023.52] loss=0.32 avg=1.22\n","[800 | 1036.01] loss=0.34 avg=1.20\n","======== SAMPLE 1 ========\n"," the town because they think it might benefit her and her family. But that money-grubbing hypocrisy was exposed years ago in one of the most shocking and disgusting performances in modern pop history. Drumlin Park was a private school for girls only. It was renamed St Mary’s for girls aged from four to ten years old.\n","The school was not your typical private school. Instead, the Headteacher’s Association chose to give St Mary’s a royal makeover. The make-up was toned down for its girl reserves. In a letter to the school’s principal, Helena Strydom, they wrote: “It’s with sadness that we learn that the ‘School of Saint Mary’s’ wish to acknowledge the tremendous contribution Saint Mary has made to the lives of her students.” \n","Schoolchildren at the other end of the Polish river, possibly the world, are bombarded by pictures of Queen Elizabeth, the Duke of Edinburgh and the Duchess of Cambridge at extraordinary times. Stunning images of the duchess, seen from all over the world, have been shown to be a royal glamour model. Her enormous and expensive looking new beauty class includes the fashion world’s leading beauties including Zulekow, Boerum and Shell. But the most stunning news has been delivered to the community leaders of St James’s. The organization that runs St James’s, which is where Beyoncé performs, has chosen to announce that the “Girls’ school at the University of Warsaw will become Girls’ Schools at St James’s College, too. \n","The announcement was made after more than 20 prominent people signed a petition calling on the Polish government to stop the acquisition and promotion of Polish classes at universities. The Polish government owns 49% of all universities in Europe and 24% are in the hands of private companies. \n","“We are deeply shocked at such shocking news,” the education secretary, Arnd Boon, told reporters. “Both the Polish and British governments, as well as the national and international media, need to put an end to this harmful policy.” \n","According to Pempel, Polish students at Polish universities take three to six months off their studies to avoid paying the cost of the expensive Polish school. The temporary British-style school is more popular than anywhere else in Poland and has an average attendance of 30,000 students a year. The average age in Poland is between 25 and 34. Its buildings are regarded as top-notch by students in other countries, including Saudi Arabia and the University of Warsaw. \n","“It’s no surprise that British students feel they need a place to study,” said Pempel. “And it’s no surprise that Polish universities attract large numbers of foreign students. The country has great world-wide tourism money, so it’s not surprising at all that students in Poland want to go to university.” But she says there is no alternative to Polish universities. She argues that the educational reforms introduced in 2009 have created a huge, rather than a minor, education shortage. \n","“The big universities in Europe have tried to slow down the process; the result is that they’re not increasing the number of their students,” she says. “It’s not as if they want to admit more students.”  \n","The head of the Polish Academy of Pediatrics, Michal Szymczycki, believes that the sudden increase in tuition costs means that thousands of Polish universities are forced to close as a result of an ever-increasing budget. He says that the sudden increase in numbers of students has “an enormous impact” on the Polish education. According to Szymczycki, Polish universities are spending an extra €23m on the Myslajek’s new lecturer position in 2014, compared with €25m in 2013. The post is in charge of teaching English to the young, rather than just teaching English to professors. \n","The 25-year-old University of Warsaw lecturer works day and night to prepare for an international degree in English and science. She can expect to earn around 2,500€ in salary, and an earned-income of €15,000 to €15,750 annually. \n","She can’t say much about the research into the causes of the English crisis, other than that she works incredibly hard every day. In spite of all the press coverage of the crisis, few people are saying anything about the fact that the way in which we communicate and communicate has become more important than ever. Although the English crisis began with the financial crash and continued with the fights with the media, few people are saying it out loud. \n","There is widespread opinion that things are getting better.

That payment was fraudulent and fraudulent in that it was made in return for a purchase of a motorbike.\n","The police investigation into the fraudulent return of the payment was stopped just days before it was due to start.\n","The police force – and, later, the Revenue Department (Recycling Authority) – were called to collect the £1.3 million owed to the Revenue Department. The agency had been under investigation in 2007 for claiming it paid only £250 of tax in England and Wales.\n","However, a copy of a 2011 investigation into the claim in the Revenue Department said the total amount owed by residents of the UK to the Revenue Department was £3.3 billion in 2007.\n","The allegation that the Revenue Department or RDO was behind the fraudulent claims is bogus, according to John Binns, a former British Revenue officer. He said that around 70% of the total amount owed by residents of the UK to the UK government was owing to unpaid taxes.\n","“The bulk of the money is due to pay for property taxes, maintenance, VAT and interest. We owe almost £50 billion in overdue taxes in the UK,” he said.\n","Around a third of all unpaid taxes is due to the government in each of the last three decades. The rest is due to be paid in full by the end of the decade. “The problem is that the government doesn’t pay attention to the part of the economy that is the payment method for a lot of people.”\n","Aboriginal people are very happy with the system,” said Binns. “The government understands that people in a democratic country want better taxes, more taxes and a system that works.”\n","But, the recent victory of the Eels and the fight for progressive taxes in Australia have forced the issue of growing inequality in the west. “The Eels have been fighting for more and more to stop our people from getting better public services,” said Binns. “More and more, the debate is about whether it’s fair.”\n","The fight for fair taxes has been going on since at least the 1920s. Inequality has been increasing in British society for some time. Beginning in the late 18th century, when the first census indicated the size of the British population, tax avoidance began. Initially, the wealthy were allowed to avoid paying their fair share of taxes. But this was stopped in 1839 when the king of Scotland, Eon Taylor, learnt that his Scottish backers in the War of 18 III were planning a war against the British government. He was trying to stop the rich from using their wealth to pay their taxes.\n","At first, the war seemed over. In the 1950s, the wealthy had to pay a lot of taxes. But, starting in the 1970s, ordinary people have started to pay more taxes because they have more money.\n","Since then, the fight for more taxes has only become more complicated. The British government has admitted that it has given the warring classes an unfair advantage. The tax rise for the top 0.1% for each additional £1.00 in gross domestic product (GDP) since 1974 has increased by 21%. Prosecutions have been launched against people suspected of having tax evasion or having paid nothing in taxes.\n","This war is just the latest example of how the system works – the Tax Justice Network has argued that British business are being evicted from their properties because they do not pay their fair share of tax. According to the report, each additional £100 in tax paid by a company increases the total by £400.\n","The report says that many companies pay little or no corporation tax in the UK. Businesses that do not pay tax may suffer negative economic effects, particularly because there is no tax deduction for losses caused by low-paid workers.\n","Some employees may suffer even more. The Tax Justice Network estimates that even people who do not pay tax may suffer from “unemployment” – those people who are not in work but are available for zero- hours work.\n","Some people would prefer to avoid paying tax on their employer’s profits, but ordinary people do not want to pay tax. “Tax avoidance is a costly business and we should not be doing it for the profits of another company,” said the Conservative MP Mike Weatherley.\n","The report says the tax avoidance tactics of the wealthy make sense but that British people need to be careful when avoiding tax. “We must be careful not to lose our sense of proportion because the balance of payments is too thin.”\n","The Tax Justice Network has suggested that legal measures, such as delaying payments on planned tax rises, could give the wealthy extra money to avoid paying their fair\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"8RmR1_vQ0nxA","colab_type":"code","colab":{}},"source":[""],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
